## üìå Introduction
Promotional campaigns play a crucial role in the retail industry, driving sales and attracting customers during festive seasons. This project aims to analyze the performance of promotional campaigns conducted by AtliQ Mart during Diwali 2023 and Sankranti 2024. By leveraging data analytics, we seek to gain insights into the effectiveness of these campaigns and provide recommendations for optimizing future marketing strategies.

## üìä Project Overview

üîë Key Insights:
Top Promotions:
500 Cashback and BOGOF drove the highest incremental revenue and sales uplift across most stores.

Underperformers:
Discount-based promotions such as 25% OFF and 50% OFF showed negative or low returns in both revenue and units sold, sometimes even cannibalizing existing sales.

Top Cities & Stores:
Cities like Bengaluru, Chennai, and Hyderabad consistently hosted high-performing stores with strong promotional responses.

Product Category Impact:
Grocery & Staples and Home Appliances showed significant sales lift, whereas Personal Care saw little to negative impact.

Store-Level Variation:
Significant variance exists across stores ‚Äî highlighting potential in standardizing successful tactics from top stores to underperformers.

üìù Summary:
This analysis unpacks store-wise, promotion-type, and product-level performance to provide a 360-degree view of AtliQ Mart‚Äôs festive campaigns. These insights form the foundation for smarter promotional planning and resource allocation in future cycles.


**Limitations and Challenges**

One significant limitation encountered during the analysis is related to the handling of promotions with the 'BOGOF' (Buy One Get One Free) promotion type. The dataset does not accurately account for the quantity of the free item provided as part of the promotion. This limitation may lead to some discrepancies or misunderstandings in the analysis, particularly when evaluating the effectiveness of 'BOGOF' promotions and comparing them with other promotion types.

**Additional Insights**
In addition to the main business requests, the following recommended insights were explored during the analysis:

üè¨ Store Performance
Q1: Top/Bottom Performing Stores
Insight:
Top-performing stores are in Bengaluru, Chennai, and Mysuru, showing strong response to promotions, while Mangalore and Trivandrum underperform, likely due to weaker demand or execution.

Q2: Performance by City
Insight:
Cities like Bengaluru and Chennai consistently outperform others, indicating higher promotion responsiveness and larger customer bases.

Q3: Common Characteristics of Top Stores
Insight:
Top stores show high footfall, strong ISU, and robust revenue gains ‚Äî often in urban, high-income regions with good promotion execution.

üí∏ Promotion Type Analysis
Q1: Top 2 Promotions by IR
Insight:
500 Cashback and BOGOF yield the highest Incremental Revenue, proving the effectiveness of value-based promotions.

Q2: Bottom 2 by ISU
Insight:
25% OFF leads to a drop in units sold, and 50% OFF shows weak volume lift, making them poor performers.

Q3: Discount vs Cashback/BOGOF
Insight:
Cashback and BOGOF far outperform discount-based promos in both IR and ISU, highlighting the ineffectiveness of flat discounts.

Q4: Balanced Promotions
Insight:
BOGOF strikes the best volume-profit balance, while 500 Cashback boosts revenue with moderate volume gain.

üß∫ Product & Category Analysis
Q1: Categories with Highest ISU
Insight:
Grocery & Staples and Home Appliances saw the strongest unit lift, indicating high consumer traction in essential and high-value items.

Q2: Product-Level Extremes
Insight:
Products like Atliq_Home_Essential Combo excel, while items like Sonamasuri Rice and Body Lotion lose money, suggesting misaligned or unnecessary promos.

Q3: Promotion-Category Correlation
Insight:
Promotions work best when matched by category ‚Äî e.g., BOGOF thrives in Grocery & Home Care, while discounts hurt performance in Personal Care and Home Care.

üßæ Conclusion
Promotions are highly effective when value-driven (BOGOF, Cashback) and strategically aligned to category and store strengths. Flat percentage discounts not only fail to drive volume but often erode margins. A data-driven approach to promotion planning, product targeting, and regional customization can significantly amplify the ROI of future marketing efforts. Focus on scalable successes and cut the ineffective tactics.
